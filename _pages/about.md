I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Toronto](https://www.linguistics.utoronto.ca/), supervised by [Susana Béjar](https://www.sbejar.ca/). I am broadly interested in syntax, semantics, linguistic fieldwork, and language revitalization.

I received my Ph.D from the Department of Linguistics at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/), under the supervision of [Jessica Coon](https://jessica.lingspace.org/) and [Luis Alonso-Ovalle](https://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~luis.alonso-ovalle/index.html). While there, I was a member of the [Montreal Underdocumented Languages Linguistics (MULL) lab](https://mull-lab.org/). Prior to that, I did my BA at the [University of British Columbia](https://linguistics.ubc.ca/). 

My current research interests revolve around questions of **tense, aspect, mood**, **argument structure**, and **verbal syntax**. My research primarily engages with these and other aspects of **Ktunaxa** \[ktu.ˈnʌ.χa], a language isolate spoken in the Columbia River Basin, and **Kanien'kéha**, an Iroquoian language spoken in Ontario, Quebec, and New York.
