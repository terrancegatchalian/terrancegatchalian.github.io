I am a second-year PhD student in the [Department of Linguistics at McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/). I recieved my BA at the [University of British Columbia](https://linguistics.ubc.ca/). 

My current research interests in syntax revolve around questions of argument structure, phi-features, and nominalization. My research primarily focusses on these and other aspects of Ktunaxa \[ktu.ˈnʌ.χa], a language isolate spoken in the Columbia River Basin.
