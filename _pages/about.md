I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/). I did my BA at the [University of British Columbia](https://linguistics.ubc.ca/). I am broadly interested in syntax, linguistic fieldwork, and language revitalization.

My current research interests in syntax revolve around questions of argument structure, phi-features, and nominalization. My research primarily engages with these and other aspects of Ktunaxa \[ktu.ˈnʌ.χa], a language isolate spoken in the Columbia River Basin.
