I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/linguistics/). I am a member of the [Montreal Underdocumented Languages Linguistics (MULL) lab](https://mull-lab.org/). I did my BA at the [University of British Columbia](https://linguistics.ubc.ca/). I am broadly interested in syntax, semantics, linguistic fieldwork, and language revitalization. 

My current research interests revolve around questions of **tense, aspect, mood**, **argument structure**, and **verbal syntax**. My research primarily engages with these and other aspects of **Ktunaxa** \[ktu.ˈnʌ.χa], a language isolate spoken in the Columbia River Basin, and **Kanien'kéha**, an Iroquoian language spoken in Ontario, Quebec, and New York. I have also worked on **Kirundi**, a Bantu language spoken in Burundi.
